## Code style
This exercise will automatically check if your code complies with the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). You will not be able to commit if it doesn't.

## Points
You will receive points for correctly completed tasks in the repository on GitHub. Check there after pushing to see how many points you achieved.
### Debugging your code
There are two ways to see where you missed points for tasks:
#### 1. Running tests locally
Run `npm test` in the terminal. You will see where your solution differs from the expected result.

#### 2. Inspecting the test output on GitHub
- Go to the [Actions tab of your exercise repo](#repoWebUrl/actions)
- You will see a list of the test runs. Click on the topmost one.
- Click on 'Autograding'
- Expand the item 'Run education/autograding@v1'
- Here you see all outputs from the test run
