### Debugging your code
> [reading the test outputs](https://github.com/DCI-EdTech/autograding-setup/wiki/Reading-test-outputs)

There are two ways to see why tasks might not be completed:
#### 1. Running tests locally
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` in the terminal. You will see where your solution differs from the expected result.

#### 2. Inspecting the test output on GitHub
- Go to the 'Actions' tab of your exercise repo
- You will see a list of the test runs. Click on the topmost one.
- Click on 'Autograding'
- Expand the item 'Run DCI-EdTech/autograding-action@main'
- Here you see all outputs from the test run
